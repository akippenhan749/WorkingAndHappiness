# Working And Happiness

This is a data analysis project looking at the relationship between time spent working and happiness. I compiled data from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) from the years 2015 through 2019 as well as from the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.oecd.org/) (OECD) for the years 2000 through 2019. Using these sources I investigated the relationships between the two sets of data using several visualizations and analyses. This repository contains the csv files used ([src](data)) as well as an RMarkdown file ([src](WorkingAndHappiness.Rmd)) containing the final report.

This project was created as part of the Communicating with Data (DS 3003) course at the University of Virginia in the Spring of 2020. A published version of this report is hosted as a Shiny app on the shinyapps.io cloud platform and can be found [here](https://akippenhan.shinyapps.io/WorkingAndHappiness/).
